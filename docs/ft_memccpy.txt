     memccpy -- copy string until character found

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     void *memccpy(void *restrict dst, const void *restrict src, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
     The memccpy() function copies bytes from string src to string dst.  
	 If the character c (as converted to an unsigned char) occurs in the string src,
	 the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy of c in the string dst is returned. 
	 Otherwise, n bytes are copied, and a NULL pointer is returned.

     The source and destination strings should not overlap, as the behavior is undefined.
