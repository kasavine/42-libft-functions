NAME
     calloc, free, malloc, realloc, reallocf, valloc -- memory allocation

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void *
     calloc(size_t count, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
     The malloc(), calloc(), valloc(), realloc(), and reallocf() functions allocate
     memory.  The allocated memory is aligned such that it can be used for any data
     type, including AltiVec- and SSE-related types.  The free() function frees allo-
     cations that were created via the preceding allocation functions.

The calloc() function contiguously allocates enough space for count objects that
     are size bytes of memory each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
     The allocated memory is filled with bytes of value zero.

The free() function deallocates the memory allocation pointed to by ptr. If ptr
     is a NULL pointer, no operation is performed.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, calloc(), malloc(), realloc(), reallocf(), and valloc() functions
     return a pointer to allocated memory.  If there is an error, they return a NULL
     pointer and set errno to ENOMEM.

     The free() function does not return a value.
