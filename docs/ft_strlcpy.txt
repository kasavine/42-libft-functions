NAME
     strlcpy, strlcat -- size-bounded string copying and concatenation

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     size_t
     strlcpy(char * restrict dst, const char * restrict src, size_t dstsize);

     size_t
     strlcat(char * restrict dst, const char * restrict src, size_t dstsize);

DESCRIPTION
     The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy and concatenate strings with the same
     input parameters and output result as snprintf(3).  They are designed to be
     safer, more consistent, and less error prone replacements for the easily misused
     functions strncpy(3) and strncat(3).

     strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the destination buffer and guaran-
     tee NUL-termination if there is room.  Note that room for the NUL should be
     included in dstsize.

     strlcpy() copies up to dstsize - 1 characters from the string src to dst, NUL-
     terminating the result if dstsize is not 0.

     strlcat() appends string src to the end of dst.  It will append at most dstsize
     - strlen(dst) - 1 characters.  It will then NUL-terminate, unless dstsize is 0
     or the original dst string was longer than dstsize (in practice this should not
     happen as it means that either dstsize is incorrect or that dst is not a proper
     string).
